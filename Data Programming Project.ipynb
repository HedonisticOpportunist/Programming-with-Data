    "# Software Testing, Automation and the Job Market - a Data Programming Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions, Project Limitations and Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Area\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyse a given dataset from a large job board in regards to software testing roles with the emphasis of the analysis placed on what the most sought for skills are in order to shed some light on the ongoing debate on whether automation testing is going to replace manual testing (e.g __[Can Manual Testing Be Completely Replaced by Automation Testing?](https://blog.qasource.com/resources/can-manual-testing-be-completely-replaced-by-automation-testing)__). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Questions\n",
    "More specifically, this project aims to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the most popular skills required for prospective software testers?\n",
    "* Which programming languages are the most popular for test automation?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Work / Project Limitations \n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions that are interesting, but are out of scope for this project are the the ones below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many job adverts mention a combination of manual and test automation both in their description?\n",
    "* How many job descriptions mention training / upskilling?\n",
    "* How many jobs exclusively focus on either manual or automation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why these problems are out of scope is because the data set used in this project is limited in terms of geographical region. Additionally, for the questions listed above a much larger dataset would be required in order to come up with a sensible analysis. Indeed -- even with a larger dataset -- the work would still be limited to one language, and this excludes analysis from countries such as China or South Korea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, one can limit the project to a specific language or region, but this kind of project still requires a large dataset that takes into consideration where the jobs are located (rural areas may have less to offer than urban ones), what time period they were posted in as well, what seniority level they address and which area of testing they are focused (e.g. performance testing). The deeper one dives into the topic, the more likely one is to find irregularities and different demands, which would make it difficult to generalise-- at least without performing some thorough analysis using metrics that are performed over a specific length of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the time required to answer such questions would be important as well: technology is in a constant state of flux, and it would be important to analyse job boards throughout a given period, with the focus placed in which areas change is happening the most and keeping an eye on how quickly some trends are growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "The motivation behind this specific area of research stems from my job as a QA where I have worked with both automation and manual testing tools. While I personally believe that a good software tester has skills in __[both white box and black box testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-black-box-testing-vs-white-box-testing/)__, I am keen to find out what philosophy the job board is leaning towards with data from job boards serving as a good basis for me to embrace this topic on a practical level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, I used to work for a software house that focused on gathering data for recruitment companies. During that time, I used to dabble a bit in job board searches in order to garner what the expectations / trends for software testers were. In fact, some of the observations related to the limits of the project come from direct exposure related to analysing data and working in relation to gathering such data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Previous Exploration of the Topic \n",
    "While __[many articles ](https://www.infoq.com/test-automation/articles/)__ have been and continue to be published on the subject already, I have not seen any students discussing this topic in our university slack channel or express much interest in software testing otherwise. Of interest; however, are the __[annual surveys carried out by Practitest](https://www.practitest.com/qa-learningcenter/webinars/learn-from-2021-state-of-testing/)__ which analyses software testing trends and provides information on its current domain. It showcases the versatility and importance of testing, especially with the rise of AI and larger teams recognising the constant need for quality assurance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of the internet, there are __[also many workshops and courses available on automation testing](https://www.theknowledgeacademy.com/courses/automation-and-penetration-testing/fundamentals-of-test-automation-/bristol/)__ with their main focus being upskilling of manual testers, which proves how important automation is as a skill set for budding software testers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acquisition of the Data Set and Choice of Data Source\n",
    "The dataset gathered comes from job boards that have public APIs available for web crawling purposes. In particular, the site \n",
    "__[The Programmable Web](https://www.programmableweb.com/news/top-10-jobs-apis-2021/brief/2021/06/30)__ proved to be a valuable source for finding APIs that were free and did not require any prior set up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that Indeed is the biggest job site aggregator, I decided to use it for my project, even though I would have preferred using a smaller site that provided guidance on how to use its API. However, I wanted to ensure that I would have sufficient data to do some preliminary analysis, which smaller job site aggregators would not necessarily have been able to offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical Implications \n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping data as _[the article ](https://www.empiricaldata.org/dataladyblog/a-guide-to-ethical-web-scraping)_ to ethical web scraping indicates can have ethical implications when dealing with sensitive data -- such as someone’s health records. These implications are important to consider, especially because malicious agents could use such sensitive information for criminal purposes -- such as a fraud. Therefore, it is important to respect the API provided by asking for permission and not aggressively scraping their site for data. \n",
    "\n",
    "While I have not asked Indeed for explicit permission, I have taken the ethics into consideration in the following manner, arguing that my use is ethical since Indeed is an aggregator that collects job listings from other sites -- this information is public and intended to be shared with other job seekers and recruiters alike. There is no sensitive information in the job listing, other than the job being offered, the requirements being sought and some general information about the company itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the data could be used to create a competitive aggregator site, the data required for such a task would have to be massive and is outside of this project’s scope, both in terms of experience and budget. Additionally, it should be noted that I am not interested in using the data for commercial purposes, but to satisfy the research questions outlined in this report before. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, while the data shall be easily available within this Notebook, there is no objective to use the data beyonds its purpose of analysing the job market trends for software testers in the UK area, and the focus here specifically lies on remote job listings. As such, while the data shall be easily available within this Notebook, there is no objective to use the data beyonds its purpose of analysing the job market trends for software testers in the UK area, and the focus here specifically lies on remote job listings. As for the frequency of the scraping, I only intend to scrape the website once or twice to receive the data I wish to have, without the need to overload its services. "

    "### The Initial ScraperHelpers.py Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Before setting out to do a more thorough scraping of the data, I wanted to play around with the basics of it, which is why I wrote two scripts that dealt with web crawling  -- scraperHelpers.py and main.py.
